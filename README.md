## Introduction
The Business Rule Engine is a simple application designed to determine user eligibility based on specified attributes like age, department, income, and experience. It utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules, allowing for dynamic creation, combination, and evaluation of these rules.

## Features
- **Create Rules**: Dynamically create rules using a string representation.
- **Combine Rules**: Combine multiple rules into a single AST.
- **Evaluate Rules**: Evaluate the combined rules against user data to determine eligibility.
- **Error Handling**: Handle invalid rule strings and data formats.
- **Data Storage**: Store rules and application metadata in a JSON format.
- **User-Friendly API**: Simple RESTful API for interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python with Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage (MongoDb)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/business-rule-engine.git
   cd business-rule-engine
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask
(Optional) If you want to use a virtual environment:

Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Run the application:


Copy code
python app.py
The application will be running on whatever port as free based on system to system.
